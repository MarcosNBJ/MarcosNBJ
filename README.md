## Hi there ! 
<img align='right' alt="Collaboration" src="assets/diversity-code.png" width="236"/>

I'm a software engineer with a passion for almost everything tech, health or education related. I have strong experience developing web, mobile and solutions for data analysis and deep learning. Nevertheless, I'm always willingly to expand and act in other areas, after all, knowledge is the key.

I also believe that every solution to a problem, every project, every business or enterprise, is made by people and to serve a purpose for people. Therefore I really believe in the importance of diversity and in the importance of the individuals themselves.
